## Code Review

To read my refinement plan for each enhancement, go [here](https://github.com/katelyn-kincaid/CS499/tree/CodeReview). 

Unfortunately, the file size for the video code review was too large to submit to GitHub. 

### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

Objectives: 
1. Create multiple objects in OpenGL
2. Maintain use of textures
3. Maintain mouse control

Unfortunately I was unable to meet all objectives I set for myself. Though I was successful in implementing a second object, I was unable to maintain the use of textures and mouse control. 

The "refined" file I submitted is still not able to meet these objectives, but it was included to show that the efforts to get there did not cease. 

You can find the full list of files pertaining to Enhancement One [here](https://github.com/katelyn-kincaid/CS499/tree/EnhancementOne).

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

Objectives:
1. Include more types of data to be sent to a JSON file
2. Remove the criteria that dictated when data would be recorded

I was able to meet both objectives I set for myself with this Enhancement.

### Enhancement Three: Databases

Objectives: 
1. Integrate MongoDB

I was able to meet the objective I set for myself with this Enhancement.
