## Self Assessment
Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU, I’ve had to complete several projects that have pushed me to become more capable in the field. Two of those projects have been showcased via the enhancements you can see more about below. 

I have had to work with python, C++, and java primarily. I’ve had to learn to interpret assembly code. I’ve had to learn various Linux commands. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve questioned whether this field was for me. Some aspects, namely interpreting assembly code, seemed far too difficult to get through. Then, when I am presented with a particularly challenging project, I found myself to be so entranced with what I was doing that hours would pass by without me noticing. I was so hyper-focused on the task at hand that I would lose track of time. 

I’ve made it to the end of this academic chapter. I’ve passed every test and trial thrown at me. To get to this stage, I’ve noticed that there are several character attributes that are necessary to success. First, you need to be able to collaborate in a team environment This includes working with peers and working with mentors. The academic environment allows us to utilize our instructors as our mentors as we learn and our fellow students as our peers. CS310 was my first experience with collaborating in a team environment, though other courses have mentioned the team dynamic. I’m aware that I do not know nearly enough in this field, so I understand that I need to work with a team to fill in all the gaps of knowledge. What I know well could be the gap of knowledge for someone else. 

Second, you need to be able to communicate to stakeholders. To excel at this attribute, you need to be able to explain what you’re doing so that someone without coding knowledge would be able to understand. This is important since you may end up working for clients that have no background in computer science, so you need to be able to explain a project in simple terms. This attribute was subtly addressed over numerous courses. In the beginning, it began with classes demanding for pseudo code. This was the first step in being able to turn plain language into coding language. It was enough to get you in the right mindset to begin a project. CS320 is what truly polished this attribute, as it required me to reflect on the actions I had taken in the code and explain everything as if I were talking to someone with no knowledge of coding. I had to translate every action I took into plain, simple language.

Third, competency in data structures and algorithms. Understanding this attribute was a key component in numerous courses. However, I felt as if I was truly able to demonstrate my competency in this attribute with my final project submission for CS350. For this project, I was tasked with creating a device that would collect data and conduct various outputs at specific instances. For example, it would only record data if it were during the day. I had to create an algorithm that accomplished this, and I was successful in it. Additionally, I had to ensure the different colored LED lights would only light up during specified conditions, which I did with another algorithm. The data that was collected had to be sent to a JSON file, which it was. Ultimately, I chose to highlight this project for Enhancement Two and Three. 

Fourth, competency in software engineering and databases. Understanding your way around a database was a common theme in many of the classes taken for computer science. CS340 was when MongoDB was initially introduced. I used what I learned from that course to enhance a separate and unrelated project by integrating MongoDB. That knowledge made Enhancement Three a complete success, which should be evidence enough that I know my way around a database. 

Fifth, understanding of security. CS405 was the first course I took that truly focused on security. It was later addressed further in CS410, but with a different focus on reverse engineering. CS405 taught me to be mindful of what I code, as it could result in unforeseen consequences like a buffer overflow. That class also taught me of new ways I could use to validate my code that could hopefully prevent any unintentional vulnerabilities. Thanks to that class, I now have a better understanding on security and how to ensure my code is as secure as possible. 

The artifacts I chose to highlight were “table” from CS330 and “weather” from CS350. “table” was the culmination of my introduction to OpenGL. I not only learned how to create 2D and 3D objects, but I also learned how to attach a texture, introduce a light source, and implement movement. This project was chosen for Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering because it focused on engineering a 3D object. I wanted to enhance it by adding more complexity in the form of a separate and unique object. 

Ultimately, I was able to create two separate and unique objects that could move independently of one another. However, I was not able to maintain my use of textures and mouse movements, making this enhancement only a partial success. To pull it off, I had to demonstrate my ability at software engineering. Though I couldn’t maintain the use the textures and mouse movements, I was successful in the implementation of two separate and unique objects that were still able to move independently from one another. 

The final project for CS350, or “weather”, was what I selected for Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures and Enhancement Three: Databases. For “weather”, I was tasked with putting together a physical device that was able to record various inputs like temperature, humidity, and light levels. I then had to set up a variety of algorithms that ensured only certain inputs would be recorded, and at specified times, and sent to a JSON file. To enhance this, I decided to increase the amount of data that would be recorded and sent to a JSON file while removing the impediment of only recording during a certain time. I also wanted to integrate MongoDB. 

I was able to accomplish this, which showcased my competency in data structures and algorithms as well as databases. Instead of the device just recording temperature and humidity data, I had it collect light levels and record exactly when the data was recorded. I wanted to expand the kind of data that was collected to make it a more useful application. It’s fine to know the temperature and humidity levels, but what good is that information if you don’t know when it was collected? That kind of questioning also demonstrates my ability to understand stakeholders. To inject that level of logic is vital in ensuring you can make your stakeholders happy. 

 I wanted to integrate MongoDB so that I could have a different way to view the data. This added a redundancy in the project while making it easier to validate that the data was collected correctly so that it would be viewable. It gave me a much easier and compact way to view the data. It also clearly demonstrated my ability to work with databases. 

### Code Review

To read my refinement plan for each enhancement, go [here](https://github.com/katelyn-kincaid/CS499/tree/CodeReview). 

Unfortunately, the file size for the video code review was too large to submit to GitHub. 

### Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering

Objectives: 
1. Create multiple objects in OpenGL
2. Maintain use of textures
3. Maintain mouse control

Unfortunately I was unable to meet all objectives I set for myself. Though I was successful in implementing a second object, I was unable to maintain the use of textures and mouse control. 

The "refined" file I submitted is still not able to meet these objectives, but it was included to show that the efforts to get there did not cease. 

You can find the full list of files pertaining to Enhancement One [here](https://github.com/katelyn-kincaid/CS499/tree/EnhancementOne).

### Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure

Objectives:
1. Include more types of data to be sent to a JSON file
2. Remove the criteria that dictated when data would be recorded

I was able to meet both objectives I set for myself with this Enhancement.

### Enhancement Three: Databases

Objectives: 
1. Integrate MongoDB

I was able to meet the objective I set for myself with this Enhancement.
